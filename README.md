## Lessons Learned

RecipEasy was our first experience with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, and we quickly adapted to the language's syntax and features thanks to our background in Java. Throughout this project, we learned the intricacies of modern Android development and how to build a user-friendly and efficient mobile app. The experience also reinforced the importance of UI/UX design and API integration in mobile applications.
